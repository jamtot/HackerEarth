My Prime

Recently you invented a brand-new definition of prime numbers. For a given set of positive integers S let's call X a prime if there are no elements in S which are divisors of X (except X itself).

You are given a set S. Find elements in it which are prime numbers for this set.

Input
The first line contains one integer N - size of the set S. The second line contains N space-separated integers - elements of S. All the numbers are pairwise different.

Output
Output one line: elements of S which are prime numbers for this set in the order they occur in the input. Separate them by whitespaces.

Constraints

N <= 100
1 <= S[i] <= 106 (1<=i<=n)
SAMPLE INPUT 
5
10 5 3 15 16
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
 5 3 16
